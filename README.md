## Contributing to documentation

### Updating the documentation
1. Fork this repository from an upstream repository to your github account (An Upstream repository is the Parent/Original repository from where you forked your repository)

2. Edit the restructuredText (.rst) or markdown (.md) files in the 
`docs/sources` folder (editing of these files can performed directly using the 
file editing tools provided by github. This will allow you to commit your 
changes to the repository.

3. Make a pull request from your fork to the master branch of the Upstream repository.

4. Your changes will be reviewed and pulled into the Upstream repository.

Over time, your fork may become out of sync with the master branch of the Upstream repository. Create a pull request on your fork to pull in the latest changes from the master branch of the Upstream repository to get your fork back up-to-date. This can be performed directly on the github website.
