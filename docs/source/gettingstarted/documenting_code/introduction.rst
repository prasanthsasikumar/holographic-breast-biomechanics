Writing effective documentation
===============================
Documentation needs to include and be structured around its **four different functions**: *tutorials*, *how-to guides*, *technical reference* and *explanation*. People working with software need these four different kinds of documentation at different times, in different circumstances - so software usually needs them all, and they should be integrated into your documentation :cite:`documentation_by_divio`.
