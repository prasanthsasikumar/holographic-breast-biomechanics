Programming languages
=====================

This section describes commonly used programming languages used in research projects.

C#
==
C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.

Learning C#
-----------
Here are a few tools/resources that can help you learn the C# programming language:
- `Microsoft tutorials <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/csharp>`_
- `W3 Schools tutorials <https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php>`_

Python
======
The python programming language is recommended for research projects.

Learning python
---------------
Here are a few tools/resources that can help you learn the python programming language:

- `Real Python tutorials <https://realpython.com/start-here/>`_
- `Pycharm Edu <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/>`_ includes interactive tutorials on how to program with python.
- `CodeCombat <https://codecombat.com>`_ helps you learn coding with python while playing a real game (sign up as a student. Select ‘individual account’ when prompted).

Python style guide
------------------
All code must follow an official style guide to ensure the code can be easily shared and understood by others.
We recommend using `google coding style <http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_ that is based on PEP8.
See `Doc string conventions (PEP257) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ for information about how to write docstrings.

Python virtual environments
