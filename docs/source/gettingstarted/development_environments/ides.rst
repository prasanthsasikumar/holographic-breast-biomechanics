Unity
=====
Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms. It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development and used for games such as Pokémon Go, Monument Valley, Call of Duty: Mobile, Beat Saber and Cuphead. It is cited to be easy to use for beginner developers and is popular for indie game development.

Command line terminal + text editor
===================================
The most basic IDE is the combination of a text editor (allowing you to edit your source code) and a command line terminal (allowing you to execute commands to build and run your source code).

.. note::
   It is recommend to use a IDE for software development as they provide tools such as graphical debuggers to help improve efficiency of the software development process.

Common editors include Gedit, Vim on Linux, Text editor on Mac, and Notepad++ on Windows.

.. note::
   It is recommend to use an editor such as Notepad++ that allows you to choose text file line-ending deliminators on Windows. See the following resource for more information (`Converting from Windows-style to UNIX-style line endings <https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/218032857-Converting-from-Windows-style-to-UNIX-style-line-endings>`_).
