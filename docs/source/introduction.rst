Introduction
============
This documentation provides tutorials for understanding the key aspects of Holographic breast biomechanics research software. This tutorial is designed for student developers who are under time constraints (e.g. Masters and PhD students). Our philosophy is to provide curated links to existing documentation (emphasising reuse), with gaps filled in as required.
The development environment consists of Unity Game engine, Python(PyCharm) and Visual studio. Application is officially supported on both Windows and Mac. For the Holographic project, the version number and asset details are provided in the software requirement section due to the limitation of Game engines to run in container-based development environment.
